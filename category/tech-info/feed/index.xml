<p>Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include&nbsp;<a href="https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/definition/expert-system">expert systems</a>, natural language processing, speech recognition and&nbsp;<a href="https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/definition/machine-vision-computer-vision">machine vision</a>.</p>



<h3>How does AI work?</h3>



<p>As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to promote how their products and services use AI. Often what they refer to as AI is simply one component of AI,&nbsp;<a href="https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/feature/Common-sense-in-AI-remains-elusive">such as machine learning</a>. AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms. No one programming language is synonymous with AI, but a few, including Python, R and Java, are popular.</p>



<p>In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training data, analyzing the data for correlations and patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions about future states. In this way, a chatbot that is fed examples of text chats can learn to produce lifelike exchanges with people, or an image recognition tool can learn to identify and describe objects in images by reviewing millions of examples.</p>



<p>AI programming focuses on three cognitive skills: learning, reasoning and self-correction.</p>



<p><strong>Learning processes.</strong>&nbsp;This aspect of AI programming focuses on acquiring data and creating rules for how to turn the data into actionable information. The rules, which are called&nbsp;<a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/algorithm">algorithms</a>, provide computing devices with step-by-step instructions for how to complete a specific task.</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-5">Blockchain seems complicated, and it definitely can be, but its core concept is really quite simple. A blockchain is a type of database. To be able to understand blockchain, it helps to first understand what a database actually is.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-7">A database is a collection of information that is stored electronically on a computer system. Information, or data, in databases is typically structured in table format to allow for easier searching and filtering for specific information. What is the difference between someone using a spreadsheet to store information rather than a database?</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-9">Spreadsheets are designed for one person, or a small group of people, to store and access limited amounts of information. In contrast, a database is designed to house significantly larger amounts of information that can be accessed, filtered, and manipulated quickly and easily by any number of users at once.Large databases achieve this by housing data on servers that are made of powerful computers. These servers can sometimes be built using hundreds or thousands of computers in order to have the computational power and storage capacity necessary for many users to access the database simultaneously. While a spreadsheet or database may be accessible to any number of people, it is often owned by a business and managed by an appointed individual that has complete control over how it works and the data within it.</p>
