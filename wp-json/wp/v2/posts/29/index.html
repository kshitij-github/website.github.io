AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms.

In this way, a chatbot that is fed examples of text chats can learn to produce lifelike exchanges with people, or an image recognition tool can learn to identify and describe objects in images by reviewing millions of examples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI programming focuses on three cognitive skills: learning, reasoning and self-correction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Learning processes.<\/strong>&nbsp;This aspect of AI programming focuses on acquiring data and creating rules for how to turn the data into actionable information.
